# mockingbird

Design System using [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [helix](https://github.com/lilactown/helix) in [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/).

A simple way to develop a user interface with a consistent user experience, without the need to clutter `cljs` code with **CSS**.

## name reference?

> "mockingbird" is for everyone!

The name is a reference to the book [To Kill a Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird) by Harper Lee. The idea is that the design system is a "mockingbird" that sings the same song everywhere.

It's impossible to talk about *"mockingbird"* without remembering the song [Mockingbird by Eminem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9bCLPwzSC0) with his daughter Hailie Jade. The song is a declaration of love from a father to his daughter.

**mockingbird** is a declaration of love for all developers ~~(frontend will never be easy for backend developers)~~.

# Overview

Mockingbird offers a set of reusable components and utilities that increases speed and beauty on your UI development. By integrating Tailwind, Helix with ReFx, Mockingbird combines utility-first CSS, tailwind-jit, functional programming, and a powerful component model in ClojureScript. This allows your team (or simply yourself) to focus on building robust, reactive interfaces without getting bogged down in styling and state management concerns.

# Getting Started

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- ClojureScript: Follow the [Clojure Installation guide](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure Installation) to set up your environment.
- Node.js: Required for managing dependencies and building your project. Download it from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/downloads).

# Installation

- Set up your project: Start by creating a new ClojureScript project, or use an existing one.

- Install Tailwind CSS: Add Tailwind CSS to your project using npm or yarn:

``` sh

npm install tailwindcss tailwind-jit shadow-cljs node-repl

```

- configure your shadow cljs:
