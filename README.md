# mockingbird

Design System using [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [helix](https://github.com/lilactown/helix) in [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/).

A simple way to develop a user interface with a consistent user experience, without the need to clutter `cljs` code with **CSS**.

## name reference?

> "mockingbird" is for everyone!

The name is a reference to the book [To Kill a Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird) by Harper Lee. The idea is that the design system is a "mockingbird" that sings the same song everywhere.

It's impossible to talk about *"mockingbird"* without remembering the song [Mockingbird by Eminem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9bCLPwzSC0) with his daughter Hailie Jade. The song is a declaration of love from a father to his daughter.

**mockingbird** is a declaration of love for all developers ~~(frontend will never be easy for backend developers)~~.

# Overview

Mockingbird offers a set of reusable components and utilities that increases speed and beauty on your UI development. By integrating Tailwind, Helix and ReFx, Mockingbird combines functional programming, a powerful component model together creating a fast and lightweight design system. This allows your team (or simply yourself) to focus on building robust, reactive interfaces without getting bogged down in styling and local state management concerns.

# Getting Started

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Clojure: Follow the [Clojure Installation guide](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure) to set up your environment.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer/current).
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/downloads).

# Installation

We distribute our software via Clojars, so you are can just plug and play!

``` clj

;; TODO

```



# Usage

# Testing Locally 

You can clone and build this repo, to see some examples of good usage of our dear Mockingbird. You can read more [here](docs/test.md).

- Set up your project: Start by creating a new ClojureScript project, or use an existing one.

- Install node dependencies with a simple command: 

``` sh
npm i
```

- configure your shadow cljs
