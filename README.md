# mockingbird

Design System using [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) in [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/).

A simple way to develop a user interface with a consistent user experience, without the need to clutter `cljs` code with **CSS**.

## name reference?

> "mockingbird" is for everyone!

The name is a reference to the book [To Kill a Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird) by Harper Lee. The idea is that the design system is a "mockingbird" that sings the same song everywhere.

It's impossible to talk about *"mockingbird"* without remembering the song [Mockingbird by Eminem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9bCLPwzSC0) with his daughter Hailie Jade. The song is a declaration of love from a father to his daughter.

**mockingbird** is a declaration of love for all developers ~~(frontend will never be easy for backend developers)~~.
